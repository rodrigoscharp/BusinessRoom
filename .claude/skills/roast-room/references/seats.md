# Seats

| Seat | Agent | Pillar | Owns the question | Brain |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bezos | `council-bezos` | Strategy and decisions | Is this the right bet, and how reversible is it? | `brains/jeff-bezos/` |
| Graham | `council-graham` | Product and startups | Is this something people actually want, and is it growing? | `brains/paul-graham/` |
| Hormozi | `council-hormozi` | Offers, pricing, and sales | Will people pay, how much, and how do we close? | `brains/alex-hormozi/` |
| Gary V | `council-garyvee` | Marketing and attention | Where does the attention come from, and is it underpriced? | `brains/gary-vaynerchuk/` |
| Martell | `council-martell` | People, hiring, and founder time | Who does this, and what does it cost the founder's calendar? | `brains/dan-martell/` |
| Wickman | `council-wickman` | Operations and scaling | Can the business run this without the founder holding it together? | `brains/gino-wickman/` |
| Buffett | `council-buffett` | Money and capital | What does it do to cash, risk, and long-term value? | `brains/warren-buffett/` |

Brain paths are relative to `.claude/skills/roast-room/`.

## Relevance weights

The Chair sets a weight per seat for each decision, before Round 1, and writes the reason in one line. Weights make the final score honest: a pricing call should lean on Hormozi, a hiring call on Martell.

| Weight | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 3 | This decision lives in the seat's pillar |
| 2 | The pillar is materially affected |
| 1 | The pillar is touched at the edges |

Every seat is at least 1. Exactly one or two seats get a 3.

## Quick council

`--quick` seats four: the two highest-weight seats, Buffett or Bezos (whichever is not already in, as the downside check), and the seat most likely to disagree with the others (the Chair names why). Use quick for reversible, low-stakes calls. Full council for anything a founder cannot easily undo.

## Natural tensions to expect

- Bezos and Buffett (long horizon, downside first) against Hormozi and Gary V (speed to cash, volume, act now).
- Graham (do things that don't scale, stay close to users) against Wickman (systems, process, accountability).
- Buffett (stay in your circle, avoid leverage) against Gary V (bet on the underpriced platform now).
- Martell (buy back your time, hire early) against Graham and Buffett (stay small and frugal until it works).

If Round 1 comes back unanimous, the Chair should be suspicious and press the seat whose pillar is most at risk in Round 2.
